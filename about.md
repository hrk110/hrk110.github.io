## Who am I?

Graduate student at CBMS, UTokyo (M1)

## Interests

### Research Interests

- computational biology, bioinformatics, especially genomics
- computer science, especially mechanisms of UNIX computers (I'm not that interested in the latest trends of ML-related things, despite their growing popularity)
- mathmatics (discrete math, graph theory)

### Others

- music (jazz, fusion, etc.). plays the piano and the guitar
- books (mainly on scientific topics), comics
- cooking. <!-- I have a medical condition that requires me to avoid high-fat foods, so I prefer cooking and eating at home rather than going out to restaurants.
